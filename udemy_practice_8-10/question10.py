# Question 10 - Functions Golf and Hotel
# Create a function called Golf that returns a random number between 1 and 6.
# Create a function called Hotel that uses Golf to simulate rolling two dice.
# Hotel should count how many turns it takes until both dice show the same number (e.g. both return 3).
# Output the total number of turns taken.
