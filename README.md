*June, 2025*

This is going to be a practice repository where I practice the new information
and skills that I'm learning on my online courses.
* I am really invested in this and am trying my best to learn new things
* That includes python, using new IDEs, getting comfortable with git, and also markdown language, which I'm currently practicing
* I really hope that this can be a productive and insightful experience for me

### My Goals For This Summer
1. Become better at learning on my own
2. Be proud of something that I built
3. Learn how to manage my own time when no one is on top of me
4. Get more comfortable working in non-ideal enviornments (time zone, loud rooms, etc.)
