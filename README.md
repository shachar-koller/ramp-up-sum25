This is going to be a practice repository where I practice the new information
and skills that I'm learning on my online courses.
* I am really invested in this and am trying my best to learn new things
* That includes python, using new IDEs, getting comfortable with git, and also markdown language, which I'm currently practicing
* I really hope that this can be a productive and insightful experience for me
